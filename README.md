# StreamIt

StreamIt is a sample website built as a final project for Sapir's web development course.

**Note:** You must manually create a `.env` file which contains the app's client ID and secret in order for it to work, as we don't push it into the Git repository for security purposes.

## Running the project

This project hosts the code for both the front-end and the back-end.

First install the dependencies with `npm install`, and then run both codes using `npm run dev` (defined inside `package.json`).
